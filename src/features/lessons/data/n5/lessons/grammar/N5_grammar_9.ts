In the position of a modifier, i.e. before a noun, the adjective will end in the syllable ~な, and the modifier can also be in the negative form. The latter is formed by dropping the ending ~な and adding the suffix 〜じゃない.
Examples:
これは静かな場所です。- This is a quiet place.
この子(こ)は親切(しんせつ)じゃない子供(こもど)です。- This child is rude.
In the predicate position, i.e. at the end of a sentence, the adjective loses the ending ~な, and the verb です is added to it. No suffixes are added to the adjective itself. An adjective in the predicate position can change over time. です/でした | (じゃないです/じゃありません) /  (じゃないかったです/じゃありませんでした )
