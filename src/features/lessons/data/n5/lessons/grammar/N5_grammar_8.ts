        `
In the attributive position, i.e., before a noun, an adjective will end in the vowel い, and the attributive can also be in the negative form. 
The latter is formed by dropping the ending ~ and adding the suffix ～くない。The exception is the adjective いい (good), which changes its root vowel to よ in all grammatical changes.
Not good: よくない。In the past tense: ～くな かったです. Exception: good - よくなかったです 
Examples:
これは面白い本です - This is an interesting book.
あれは大きくない車です - That is a small car.
これはよくない辞書です。- This is not a good dictionary.
私の家は大きくないです。- My house is not big.
この木は古かったです。- This tree was old.
あの映画は面白くなかったです。- That movie was not interesting.
