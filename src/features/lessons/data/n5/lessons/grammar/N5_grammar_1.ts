        `In Japanese, there are three main styles of speech depending on
the level of politeness. Namely:
1) Simple, or familiar style
“Familiar” does not mean rude, but rather friendly. This refers to
communication using the informal “you.” This style is usually used when communicating with relatives and
friends, as well as when writing diaries. Interestingly, when communicating with the same person,
Japanese people can switch from one style to another. For example,
a person may start communicating with their colleagues at work in a simple form,
but when writing a letter, they will switch back to a neutral-polite style.
2) Neutral-polite style
On the one hand, in terms of politeness, it corresponds to our communication using
“you,” but at the same time, it should be noted that even verbs expressing one's own actions
are put into a polite form. On social media, Japanese people use
the neutral-polite style, as they are addressing a wide audience.
Usually, the study of Japanese begins with this style, because when we arrive in Japan,
the first people we encounter are strangers.
3) Keigo, or polite style
It ranks higher than the neutral polite style. Keigo is used in business communication,
at official events, and when employees of various
establishments communicate with customers. This style, in turn, is divided into kenjogo and
sonkeigo. The first is used to describe one's own actions, as well as the actions of
one's relatives and company employees. The second is used when it is necessary
to talk about the actions of the interlocutor or a third person. The keigo system is quite
cumbersome and confusing, and sometimes even the Japanese themselves make mistakes in its forms.`
