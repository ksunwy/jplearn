To form an interrogative sentence, you must place the interrogative particle か at the end.
The word order does not change. A period is placed after the particle; a question mark is used only when the particle か is omitted (as is the case, for example, in simple speech).
Examples:
愛子ちゃんは学生ですか。 - Is Aiko a student?
これは何ですか。 - What is this?
