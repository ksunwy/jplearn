        `
Spatial postpositions are necessary to convey concepts such as “on the table,” “under the chair,” and “behind the house.” In English, we use prepositions such as “in,” “on,” “behind,” etc. for this purpose, while in Japanese we use postpositions, which, as their name suggests, are placed after the nouns to which they refer.
Let's start by familiarizing ourselves with these postpositions:
前 (まえ) - in front of,
後ろ (うしろ) - behind,
上 (うえ) - on, above,
下 (した) - under,
中 (なか) - inside, in;
外 (そと) outside.
右 (みぎ) - right,
左 (ひだり) - left,
近く (ちかく) - nearby,
隣 (となり) - next door,
側 (そば) - next to,
横 (よこ) - beside,
向い (むかい) - opposite,
間 (あいだ) - between
These spatial postpositions are connected to nouns through the genitive case の
Examples:
椅子の上に猫がいます - There is a cat on the chair.
木と車の間に石があります - There is a stone between the tree and the car. 
学校の近くで昼ご飯を食べます - I eat lunch near the school.
I walked in front of the station.
