Adjectives themselves do not have suffixes or endings that convey the meaning of “more,” “higher,” etc. To create the comparative degree,
we will use the same form of adjectives,
but we will indicate what the object is big in relation to. The comparative degree
is formed using the comparative case.
Examples:
東京は大きいです。- Tokyo is big.
東京は大阪より大きいです。- Tokyo is bigger than Osaka. (Note that the form of the adjective is the same).
Also, in this construction, instead of 〜より, the postposition の方が (ho hou ga) can be used. In this case, より will usually be at the beginning of the sentence and claim the role of the topic (or よりは).
For example:
パンよりはシャープペンシルの方が便利です。(shaapu penshiru) - A mechanical pencil is more convenient than a pen (literally: rather than a pen, a mechanical pencil is more convenient).
If you need to ask a question comparing two options, the grammatical structure will look like this: ～と、～と～どちら（どっ
ち）が～ですか。
Examples:
りんごと、みかんとどちらが好きですか。- Which do you like more: apples or tangerines?
りんごの方が好きです。 - I like apples more.
